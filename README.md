## Contributing

The app is written in [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/), a [functional programming language](http://blog.jenkster.com/2015/12/what-is-functional-programming.html) for the web.

To run it locally, install Elm 0.18, then run `make live` from the project directory, then go to `localhost:8000` in your browser.

If you get stuck, raise an issue or pull request and let me know what went wrong.

The code is organised into 
- Types (the data model)
- State (the behaviours)
- Views (the user interface)

See Kris Jenkins' blog post [How I structure Elm apps](http://blog.jenkster.com/2016/04/how-i-structure-elm-apps.html).

I'm using the [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) CSS framework for the UI components.

These things would be great [pull requests](http://hisham.hm/2016/01/01/how-to-make-a-pull-request-on-github-a-quick-tutorial/):

- Let the user hear each number in Korean
- Add more numbers
- Translate from English -> Korean instead of just Korean -> English
- Some kind of gamification
- Add full sentences with counting particles
- Add things that aren't numbers
